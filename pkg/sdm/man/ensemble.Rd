\title{Ensemble Forecasting of SDMs}

\description{
Make a Raster object with a weighted averaging over all predictions from several fitted model in a sdmModel object.
}
\usage{
\S4method{ensemble}{sdmModels}(x, newdata, filename="",setting,...)
}


\arguments{
  \item{x}{a sdmModels object}
  \item{newdata}{Raster* object or data.frame}
  \item{filename}{character, output file name}
  \item{setting}{list, contains the parameters that are used in the ensemble procedure; see details}
  \item{...}{additional arguments passed to the predict function}
  
  }
\details{
ensemble function uses the fitted models in an \code{sdmModels} object to generate an ensemble/consensus of predictions by individual models. Several methods do exist for this procedure, that are (or will be) implemented in this function, and can be defined in the method argument.
A list can be introduced in the \code{setting} argument in which several parameters can be set including:

- method: specify which ensemble method should be used. Currently, 'unweighted' (unweighted averaging), and 'weighted' (weighted averaging) are implemented, but more methods will be added.

- stat: if the method='weighted' is used, this specify which evaluation statistics can be used as weight in the weighted averaging procedure. Alternatively, one may directly introduce weights (see the next argument)

- weights: an optional numeric vector (with a length equal to the models that are successfully fitted) to specify the weights for weighted averaging procedure (if the method='weighted' is specified)

- id: specify the model IDs that should be considered in the ensemble procedure. If missing, all the models that are successfully fitted are considered.

- wtest: specify which test dataset ("training","test.dep","test.indep") should be used to extract the statistic (stat) values as weights (if a relevant method is specified)
